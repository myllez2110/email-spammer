# (OUTDATED) email-spammer
A simple python gmail spammer, using the smtplib module. (works only with gmail for now.)
Warning: You need to go to the less secure apps config into your google account (https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) and activate it!

EDIT 2024: It has been ages since I did this code (I got better at it, I hope), honestly i cant remember why, its useless and outdated nowadays so I'm gonna archive it.
